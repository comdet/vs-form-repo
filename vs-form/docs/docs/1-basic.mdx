import Form from '../components'

## Minimal Example
Each schema has a `components` key , which defines the components-collection.
This is a minimal schema with only 1 field defined:

<Form schemaName={'minimal'} />

## Components
Each `component` has a `type` property.
The types  can be divided into the following categories:

### Containers

Each `component` in a schema is children of a container (like form, panel, card or tab).
The top-level container is the `root` container, which is usually a form tag.
(But it can also be any other container like a panel or a card). If the root container is missing (like in the minimal example above), SchemaManger will add it.
But usually you should be explicit and provide a root-key.

### Data components

The current values of the form are stored in the `values` object of the schema.
It has a key for every data-component which has a `data.field` property.
You can initialize it with your own values. You can also use the `data.default` property to provide default values.
If no `values` property is provided, SchemaManger will add default values.

### Static components
Static components (like text or button), have no data-property.

### Subschema

See [Subschema](/docs-4-subschema/)

### Custom components

See [Custom components](/docs-5-custom/)

### Form submission
A Form can be submitted with the help of a button by adding a property `action: ButtonAction.save` to a button component.
Alternatively, a Form can be submitted with SchemaManger.submit().
Then the values will be validated and the `onSubmit()` event on the schema will be called.

The cancel button has a `action: ButtonAction.cancel` property. This will revert the values since the last submit.
Then the `onCancelValues` event will be called, if one is defined.

## Basic Form with submit and cancel buttons

<Form schemaName={'basic'} />
