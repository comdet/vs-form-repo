## Grid System

vs-form has the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/layout/grid/) responsive Grid System for
a flexible layout on each device built in without hassle.
Each component has a `gridItem` property which accpets the properties of the corresponding material-ui Grid component with `item=true`.

    ...
    gridItem: {
      xs: 12,
      sm: 10,
      md: 8,
      lg: 6
      xl: 4,
    },

Each Container Component has a `gridConatiner` property which accpets the corresponding material-ui Grid component with `container=true`.

    ...
    gridContainer: {
      direction: "column",
      spacing: 16,
      alignItems: "center",
      alignContent: "stretch"
    },


<Form schemaName={'grid'} />
