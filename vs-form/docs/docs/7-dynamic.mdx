import Form, {TableForm} from '../components'

## Events and methods

Events of the schema and the individual components allows you to hook into the different lifecycle methods.
The parameter of an event is an object, which gives you access to the current schema and the SchemaManager.
Events of a component also gives you access to the inducing component, and in data-components the value.


    const schema = {
      onCreated(p) {
        p.schema.values = ... //  access schema
        p.schemaManager...    // access SchemaManager methods
      },
      onChange(p) {
      },
      components: {
        text1: {
          type: Component.textinput,
          data: {
            field: 'text1',
            dataType: DataType.string,
            onChange(p) {
              const comp = p.schema.components.text2
              p.schemaManager.updateValue('text2', p.value)
              p.schemaManager.renderComponents([comp])
            },
          },
        }
      }
    }



## Dynamically change properties

Oftentimes, we want to change props depending what the user enters.
For that, use the onChange or OnBeforeChange event-handler.
To change values or properties of components at runtime, just changing the props is not enough though.
Also the `render` or `renderComponent(s)` method of the `SchemaManager` has to be called.

<Form schemaName={'dynamic'} />

## Pass parameters to the schema

A common scenario is to use data from outside within a schema.
You can do that by simply wrapping the schema in a function and pass the data as parameters,
similar to a react functional component:

<Form schemaName={'dynamicPopulate'} />

## CRUD Example

<TableForm />
