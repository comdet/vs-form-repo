# Styles


## CSS Styles
With the styles object, you can define <Link link="https://material-ui.com/customization/css-in-js/" text="css-styles" /> that then can be applied to the components via the className prop.

Styles can be defined either on the schema or on a component:
If defined on the schema, it can then be applied to any component in that schema.
If defined on the component, it can only be applied to that component.

## Inline-Styles

Inline styles are defined with the props.style object. They offer less possibilities than CSS Styles (for example no pseudo classes), but are great
for dynamic behavior.

## CSS Styles Example

This example show the use of a styled button and and pseudo classes like :hover or :focus on input fields.

<Form schemaName={'styles'} />
